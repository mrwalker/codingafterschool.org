            <p>
            Coding After School is a programming club for kindergarteners at
            Spicewood Elementary.  Inspired by the success of the Hour of Code
            and based on the same educational software and curriculum from
            Code.org, Coding After School is a fun way for kids to learn to
            program a computer.
            </p>

            <p>
            The club should motivate students to learn and practice programming
            on their own, and they will be sent home with additional resources
            for coding outside the club.
            </p>

            <p>
            We will be running one session for kindergarten in the spring 2020
            semester.  Details will be provided when available.
