            <a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Is Your Child Coding After School?</h3>

            <p>
            Coding After School is a programming club for kindergarteners at
            Spicewood Elementary.  Inspired by the success of the Hour of Code and
            based on the same educational software and curriculum from Code.org,
            Coding After School is a fun way for kids to learn to program a computer.
            </p>

            <p>
            The club should motivate students to learn and practice programming
            on their own, and they will be sent home with additional resources
            for coding outside the club.
            </p>

            <p>
            We will be meeting Mondays in the library from 2:45-3:30 pm April
            6th through May 18th. Space is limited to 15 students.  Your child
            will be escorted to the front of the school when it is time to go.
            </p>
